# TF2 for .NET

Based on https://github.com/schiller-de/tf2_dotnet, ported to work with the ros2cs framework https://github.com/BlackAndGoldAutonomousRacing/ros2cs based off of https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs



The package `tf2_msgs` must be built with `ros2_dotnet` support, so include the [geometry2 repository](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/) (with the right branch for your ROS distribution) in your workspace.

This was tested with ROS2 Humble.
